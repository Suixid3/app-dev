**One Piece is a manga and anime series that follows Monkey D. Luffy, a young boy with a dream to become the greatest pirate in the world. As a child, he eats a mystical plant called a Devil Fruit that grants him the power to stretch like rubber. The series starts as Luffy ventures out into the world for the first time and starts to amass a crew of pirates. The main group grows over time but starts with the founding members of Luffy, Nami the navigator, and a swordsman named Roronoa Zoro (localized as Zolo in some Western versions of comic). Eventually, Luffy and his crew become known as the Straw Hat Pirates, and his posse undertakes a series of swashbuckling adventures across the ocean.**
